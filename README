Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly.

To build Tor from source:
        ./configure && make && make install

To build Tor from a just-cloned git repository:
        sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

--- Description ---

This folder contains information needed to run the moneTor statistics colleciton
functionality. Tor nodes calculate a fixed set of statistics in RAM during
within the Tor executable. Results from a single node/window are published to
mt_stats/published. Periodically, a central server elsewhere aggregate the
published statistics from all recording nodes and delete the local copies.

--- Instructions ---

Compile this Tor version, use and set the torrc MoneTorStatistics field. MoneTorStatistics is
a decimal from [0 - 1] that encodes the random fraction of circuits that will
be recorded.

in mt_stats/

At a separate central server, schedule a cron job (hourly is recommended) for
mt_stats/scripts/central.sh. The outputed information will be continously
updated for each port within the mt_stats/aggregate/ folder.
